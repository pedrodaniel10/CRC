# Project 2
Deadline: Dec 1, 2019

## 1. Goal
You will be free to choose a topic on network science, scientific computing, modelling and simulation which is close to your background and interests. You can find a first list of suggestions here.  We will continue to add suggestions in during the semester.

Ideally, all groups will address a different topic, such that, at the end of the semester, we may organize a small workshop in which we all discuss each other projects. Each group will be able to select a topic/challenge, which typically includes the discussion and (hopefully) the replication of some published results. 

The deliverables are:

1. a short (10-15 minute) in-class presentation of the project results, and
1. a short write-up (max 8 pages) and related code (if applicable or central to the project). 

Format and delivery

The maximum number of pages for the report is 8. It should contain a small introduction, a summary of gathered results, a brief discussion and supporting references. Please include any code you find relevant with your submission (you may submit a single zip file). Given the multitude of third-party libraries you may use, it would be very helpful if you add a readme file with an overview of the code, dependencies, configuration/installation instructions, etc. Otherwise, it will be hard for us to evaluate your effort... Many thanks in advance! 

## 2. What to compute? Some suggestions...
- Characterize the average degree and degree distribution of the network. 
- Clustering coefficient and average path length. 
- Infer the importance (centrality) of each node (choose one relevant centrality measure for the chosen dataset and justify your choice).   
- Suggest a set of principles responsible for the self-organization and creation of such network topology/topologies.

## 3. Where can I find interesting datasets and useful tools?
Please check the end of our Problem sets / Lab sections. Thanks!

## 4. Format and delivery
The maximum number of pages for the report is 3. It should contain a brief introduction, a summary of gathered results (if any), a brief discussion and supporting references. The report must be uploaded in pdf format using the Fenix system. If applicable, we ask you to include any code you find relevant with the submission (you may submit a single zip file) or to include a link to your code in the report, assuming that you make it available in a public repository.
