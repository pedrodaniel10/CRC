# Project 1
Deadline: October 20, 2019

## 1. Goal
In this assignment, you are invited to characterize a real-world dataset, in line with what was discussed and seen in both theoretical and lab lessons. The goal is to get acquainted with tools and methods that may be later useful for your 2nd project. The topic is rather open such that you get the opportunity to explore what interests you most, but please let us know how we may help. 

You may choose a relatively small network or a large-scale graph (check our [problem sets section](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/CRC7/2019-2020/1-semestre/laboratories-a5a) for a list of empirical networks). Depending on this choice, you may address this project resorting to different tools, while addressing distinct technical obstacles. We suggest one of the following options: 

1. Pick two to three relatively small networks, analyzing it through a graphical user interface (such as [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)). Try to compare these networks resorting to the topological quantities discussed below (or any other you find suitable).
1. Choose one dataset, and analyze it by developing your own network code in your favorite language, implementing some of the metrics discussed in the course (as you will see, this is straightforward and may be useful for the second project). You may also use one of the network libraries available (in Python, C/C++, Mathematica, Matlab, etc). This will allow you to analyze larger networks, but not the largest ones (see next point).
1. To analyze the largest sets available you would need succinct data structures. You may choose to focus on computational challenges concerning the characterization of these extremely large networks. For instance, you can use and explore Webgraph (developed at Laboratory for web algorithmics of the University of Milan, Italy) and the datasets available [here](http://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php). 

## 2. What to compute? Some suggestions...
- Characterize the average degree and degree distribution of the network. 
- Clustering coefficient and average path length. 
- Infer the importance (centrality) of each node (choose one relevant centrality measure for the chosen dataset and justify your choice).   
- Suggest a set of principles responsible for the self-organization and creation of such network topology/topologies.

## 3. Where can I find interesting datasets and useful tools?
Please check the end of our Problem sets / Lab sections. Thanks!

## 4. Format and delivery
The maximum number of pages for the report is 3. It should contain a brief introduction, a summary of gathered results (if any), a brief discussion and supporting references. The report must be uploaded in pdf format using the Fenix system. If applicable, we ask you to include any code you find relevant with the submission (you may submit a single zip file) or to include a link to your code in the report, assuming that you make it available in a public repository.
